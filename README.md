[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/zzet/gortex)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/zzet/gortex)

Code intelligence engine that indexes repositories into an in-memory knowledge graph and exposes it via CLI, MCP Server, and web UI.

Built for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) — one `smart_context` call replaces 5-10 file reads, cutting token usage by ~94%.

## Features

- **Knowledge graph** — every file, symbol, import, call chain, and type relationship in one queryable structure
- **Multi-repo workspaces** — index multiple repositories into a single graph with cross-repo symbol resolution, project grouping, reference tags, and per-repo scoping
- **25 languages** — Go, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Rust, Java, C#, Kotlin, Swift, Scala, PHP, Ruby, Elixir, C, C++, Bash, SQL, Protobuf, Markdown, HTML, CSS, YAML, TOML, HCL, Dockerfile
- **44 MCP tools** — symbol lookup, call chains, blast radius, community detection, process discovery, contract verification, cycle detection, dead code analysis, scaffolding, multi-repo management, and 6 agent-optimized tools
- **6 MCP resources** — lightweight graph context without tool calls
- **Two-tier config** — global config (`~/.config/gortex/config.yaml`) for projects and repo lists, per-repo `.gortex.yaml` for guards, excludes, and local overrides
- **Guard rules** — project-specific constraints (co-change, boundary) enforced via `check_guards`
- **Watch mode** — surgical graph updates on file change across all tracked repos, live sync with agents
- **Web UI** — Sigma.js force-directed visualization with node size proportional to importance
- **IMPLEMENTS inference** — structural interface satisfaction for Go, TypeScript, Java, Rust, C#, Scala, Swift, Protobuf
- **PreToolUse hooks** — automatic graph context injection on Read and Grep
- **Benchmarked** — per-language parsing, query engine, indexer benchmarks
- **Zero dependencies** — everything runs in-process, in memory, no external services

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build (requires CGO for tree-sitter C bindings)
go build -o gortex ./cmd/gortex/

# Set up Gortex for a project (creates configs for Claude Code + Kiro IDE)
gortex init /path/to/repo

# Or with codebase analysis for a richer CLAUDE.md
gortex init --analyze /path/to/repo

# Index a repo and print stats
gortex status --index /path/to/repo

# Start MCP server with watch mode
gortex serve --index /path/to/repo --watch

# Multi-repo: track additional repos and set active project
gortex serve --index /path/to/repo --track /path/to/other-repo --project my-project
gortex track /path/to/another-repo
gortex untrack /path/to/another-repo
```

## Usage with Claude Code

After running `gortex init`, Claude Code automatically starts Gortex via `.mcp.json`. The agent gets:

- **Slash commands:** `/gortex-guide`, `/gortex-explore`, `/gortex-debug`, `/gortex-impact`, `/gortex-refactor`
- **Global skills:** installed to `~/.claude/skills/` — available across all repos
- **PreToolUse hook:** automatic graph context on Read/Grep calls
- **CLAUDE.md instructions:** mandatory tool usage table and session workflow

## Multi-Repo Workspaces

Gortex can index multiple repositories into a single shared graph, enabling cross-repo symbol resolution, impact analysis, and navigation.

### Configuration

Two-tier config hierarchy:

- **Global config** (`~/.config/gortex/config.yaml`) — projects, repo lists, active project, reference tags
- **Workspace config** (`.gortex.yaml` per repo) — guards, excludes, local overrides (workspace wins when both define the same setting)

```yaml
# ~/.config/gortex/config.yaml
active_project: my-saas

repos:
  - path: /home/user/projects/gortex
    name: gortex

projects:
  my-saas:
    repos:
      - path: /home/user/projects/frontend
        name: frontend
        ref: work
      - path: /home/user/projects/backend
        name: backend
        ref: work
      - path: /home/user/projects/shared-lib
        name: shared-lib
        ref: opensource
```

### CLI

```bash
gortex track /path/to/repo          # Add a repo to the workspace
gortex untrack /path/to/repo        # Remove a repo from the workspace
gortex serve --track /path/to/repo  # Track additional repos on startup
gortex serve --project my-saas      # Set active project scope
gortex index repo-a/ repo-b/        # Index multiple repos
gortex status                       # Per-repo and per-project stats
```

### MCP Tools

Agents can manage repos at runtime without CLI access:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `track_repository` | Add a repo, index immediately, persist to config |
| `untrack_repository` | Remove a repo, evict nodes/edges, persist to config |
| `set_active_project` | Switch project scope for all subsequent queries |
| `get_active_project` | Return current project name and repo list |

All query tools (`search_symbols`, `get_symbol`, `find_usages`, `get_file_summary`, `get_call_chain`, `smart_context`) accept optional `repo`, `project`, and `ref` parameters for scoping. When an active project is set, it applies as the default scope.

### How It Works

- **Qualified Node IDs** — in multi-repo mode, IDs become `<repo_prefix>/<path>::<Symbol>` (e.g., `frontend/src/app.ts::App`). Single-repo mode keeps the existing `<path>::<Symbol>` format.
- **Cross-repo edges** — the resolver links symbols across repo boundaries with same-repo preference. Cross-repo edges carry a `cross_repo: true` flag.
- **Impact analysis** — `explain_change_impact`, `verify_change`, and `get_test_targets` follow cross-repo edges automatically, grouping results by repository.
- **Shared repos** — the same repo can appear in multiple projects with different reference tags. It's indexed once and shared across projects.
- **Auto-detection** — set `workspace.auto_detect: true` in `.gortex.yaml` to auto-discover Git repos in a parent directory.

## Usage with Kiro

`gortex init` also sets up Kiro IDE integration automatically:

- **MCP server:** `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` — all 40 tools auto-approved for zero-friction use
- **Steering files:** `.kiro/steering/gortex-workflow.md` (always active) teaches Kiro to prefer graph queries over file reads. Additional manual steering files for explore, debug, impact, and refactor workflows are available via `#` in chat.
- **Agent hooks:**
  - `gortex-smart-context` — on each prompt, assembles task-relevant context from the graph in one call
  - `gortex-post-edit` — after saving source files, shows blast radius and which tests to run
  - `gortex-pre-read` — before reading source files, enriches with symbol context from the graph

## CLI Commands

```
gortex init [path]           Set up Gortex for a project + install global skills

gortex track <path>          Add a repository to the tracked workspace
gortex untrack <path>        Remove a repository from the tracked workspace

## Web UI

When running `gortex serve`, a web visualization is available at `http://localhost:8765`:

- Sigma.js force-directed graph with ForceAtlas2 layout
- Node size proportional to degree (connection count = importance)
- Color-coded by kind (function, type, interface, method, variable, file)
- Real-time updates via SSE when watch mode is active
- Filter by node kind, hide test files, search by name
- Click nodes to highlight neighborhood

## Architecture

```
gortex binary
  CLI (cobra)  ──> MultiIndexer ──> In-Memory Graph (shared, per-repo indexed)
  MCP Server ──────────────────────> Query Engine (repo/project/ref scoping)
  Web Server ──────────────────────> (Nodes + Edges + byRepo index)
                   MultiWatcher <── filesystem events (fsnotify, per-repo)
                   CrossRepoResolver ──> cross-repo edge creation
```

**Data flow:**
1. MultiIndexer walks each repo directory concurrently, dispatches files to language-specific extractors (tree-sitter)
2. Extractors produce nodes (files, functions, types, etc.) and edges (calls, imports, defines, etc.)
3. In multi-repo mode, nodes get `RepoPrefix` and IDs become `<repo_prefix>/<path>::<Symbol>`
4. Resolver links cross-file references; CrossRepoResolver links cross-repo references with same-repo preference
5. Query Engine answers traversal queries with optional repo/project/ref scoping
6. MultiWatcher detects changes per-repo and surgically patches the graph (debounced per-file), then re-resolves cross-repo edges

## Graph Schema

**Node kinds:** `file`, `function`, `method`, `type`, `interface`, `variable`, `import`, `package`

**Edge kinds:** `calls`, `imports`, `defines`, `implements`, `extends`, `references`, `member_of`, `instantiates`

**Multi-repo fields:** Nodes carry `repo_prefix` (empty in single-repo mode). Edges carry `cross_repo` (true when connecting nodes in different repos). Node IDs use `<repo_prefix>/<path>::<Symbol>` format in multi-repo mode.
