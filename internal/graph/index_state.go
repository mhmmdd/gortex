// RepoIndexState is the per-repo freshness provenance recorded at the
// end of a (re)index: the git revision the graph reflects, whether the
// working tree was dirty at index time, the Merkle workspace
// fingerprint that gates global-pass short-circuiting, node/edge counts
// for the index-plausibility baseline, and a JSON map of the
// per-language extractor versions that produced the graph.
//
// It is the storage half of the FreshnessFact layer; the per-file half
// lives in the Merkle leaf (the salted content hash) and the file_mtimes
// ledger.
