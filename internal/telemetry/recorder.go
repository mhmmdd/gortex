//   - Consent-gated: a recorder built from disabled consent records nothing,
//     opens no file, and creates no telemetry directory.
//   - Nil-safe: a nil *Recorder's methods are no-ops, so call sites need no
//     branch (handlers stay clean).
//   - Fail-silent: recording is an in-memory map increment under a short mutex;
//     disk errors on flush are swallowed, never retried, never surfaced.
