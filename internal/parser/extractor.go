//
// Implementations MUST preserve byte offsets and line counts exactly — the
// returned slice has the same length as the input and every newline stays in
// place — so all extracted node ranges, line numbers, and downstream
// resolution remain byte-accurate. Returning nil means "no rewrite".

// implement it because their inputs are large and their per-unit processing
// never needs the whole file resident. The indexer prefers this path when it is
// available (on the in-process route), so peak memory is O(one unit), not
// O(file).

// emit is called once per produced node with that node's outgoing edges (pass
